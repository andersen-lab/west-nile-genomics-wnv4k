#### Summary

By partnering with West Nile virus surveillance labs across the country, the [WestNile 4K Project](https://westnile4k.org/) is planning to sequence more than 4,000 virus genomes to reconstruct a high definition picture of West Nile virus spread and evolution during the last 20 years in the United States. The data that they generate will be immediately released and, along with other entomological data, will be used to uncover local transmission dynamics. As little progress has been made in effectively controlling West Nile virus outbreaks since its emergence, their goal is to use fine-scale transmission networks revealed through virus genomics to better design targeted control measures.

#### Raw Data

The BAM files are available on [Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/andersen-lab_project_westnile4k_genomics).

The sequencing is being performed using an amplicon-based sequencing scheme using [PrimalSeq](https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2017.066). Our full protocol is available online [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PilT4w5jHO-ROsE8TL5WBGa0wSCdTHAsNl1LIOYiTgk/edit?usp=sharing). Sequencing data is aligned using [bwa](https://github.com/lh3/bwa) and processed using [iVar](https://github.com/andersen-lab/ivar) ([Grubaguh et al. Genome Biology 2019](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-018-1618-7)).

Below is a table showing the number of sequenced genomes by state.
