#### Summary

By partnering with West Nile virus surveillance labs across the country, the [WestNile 4K Project](https://westnile4k.org/) is planning to sequence more than 4,000 virus genomes to reconstruct a high definition picture of West Nile virus spread and evolution during the last 20 years in the United States. The data that they generate will be immediately released and, along with other entomological data, will be used to uncover local transmission dynamics. As little progress has been made in effectively controlling West Nile virus outbreaks since its emergence, their goal is to use fine-scale transmission networks revealed through virus genomics to better design targeted control measures.

#### Collaborators

The samples from San Diego county were provided by Nikos Garfield and Saran Grewal from the [San Diego County Vector Control Program](https://www.sandiegocounty.gov/deh/pests/vector_disease.html). The samples from all the other counties in California, including Sacramento-Yolo and Kern were provided by Ying Fang and Chris Barker from the [Barker Lab, University of California, Davis](https://barkerlab.ucdavis.edu/) and Sarah Wheeler from [Sacramento-Yolo Mosquito and Vector Control Program](https://www.fightthebite.net/).

The samples from IA, ID, and the US Virgin Islands were provided by [Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (WADDL)](https://waddl.vetmed.wsu.edu/).
The samples from OR were provided by the [Oregon Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory](https://vetmed.oregonstate.edu/diagnostic).

The samples from WA were provided by [Krisztian Magori](https://sites.ewu.edu/diseaseecology/krisztian-magori-phd/) from the Eastern Washington University, Amy Salamone, Wayne Clifford, David Kangiser from the [Washington State Department of Health](https://www.doh.wa.gov/), the [Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (WADDL)](https://waddl.vetmed.wsu.edu/), and the [Oregon Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory](https://vetmed.oregonstate.edu/diagnostic).

The samples from NH were provided by Denise Bolton, Abigail Mathewson, Carolyn Fredett, Amy Kutschke and Rebecca Lovell at the [New Hampshire Division of Public Health Services, Department of Health and Human Services](https://www.dhhs.nh.gov/).

Tha samples from LA were provided by Udeni Balasuriya, Rebecca Christofferson, Tarra Harden, Zelalem Mekuria, Laura Peak, Alma Roy, and Keith Strother from the [Louisiana Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory](https://www.lsu.edu/vetmed/laddl/) at Louisiana State University.

The samples from MN were provided by David Neitzel from the [Minnesota Department of Health](https://www.health.state.mn.us/index.html).

#### Raw Data

The BAM files are available on [Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/andersen-lab_project_westnile4k_genomics).

The sequencing is being performed using an amplicon-based sequencing scheme using [PrimalSeq](https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2017.066). Our full protocol is available online [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PilT4w5jHO-ROsE8TL5WBGa0wSCdTHAsNl1LIOYiTgk/edit?usp=sharing). Sequencing data is aligned using [bwa](https://github.com/lh3/bwa) and processed using [iVar](https://github.com/andersen-lab/ivar) ([Grubaguh et al. Genome Biology 2019](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-018-1618-7)).

Below is a table showing the number of sequenced genomes by state.
