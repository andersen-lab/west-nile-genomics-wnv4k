#### Summary

By partnering with West Nile virus surveillance labs across the country, the [WestNile 4K Project](https://westnile4k.org/) is planning to sequence more than 4,000 virus genomes to reconstruct a high definition picture of West Nile virus spread and evolution during the last 20 years in the United States. The data that they generate will be immediately released and, along with other entomological data, will be used to uncover local transmission dynamics. As little progress has been made in effectively controlling West Nile virus outbreaks since its emergence, their goal is to use fine-scale transmission networks revealed through virus genomics to better design targeted control measures.

#### Collaborators

The samples from San Diego county were provided by Nikos Garfield and Saran Grewal from the [San Diego County Vector Control Program](https://www.sandiegocounty.gov/deh/pests/vector_disease.html). The samples from all the other counties in California, including Sacramento-Yolo and Kern were provided by Ying Fang and Chris Barker from the [Barker Lab, University of California, Davis](https://barkerlab.ucdavis.edu/) and Sarah Wheeler from [Sacramento-Yolo Mosquito and Vector Control Program](https://www.fightthebite.net/).

The samples from WA were provided by [Krisztian Magori](https://sites.ewu.edu/diseaseecology/krisztian-magori-phd/) from the Eastern Washington University, Amy Salamone, Wayne Clifford and David Kangiser from the [Washington State Department of Health](https://www.doh.wa.gov/).

The samples from NH were provided by Denise Bolton, Abigail Mathewson, Carolyn Fredett, Amy Kutschke and Rebecca Lovell at the [New Hampshire Division of Public Health Services, Department of Health and Human Services](https://www.dhhs.nh.gov/).
